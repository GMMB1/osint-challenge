# 📖 The Story of Marten Dóna

Marten Dóna is 32 years old, born in Russia, now living far away in Tokyo, Japan.
Once, life looked different. He had a wife, Rujin, whom he met during his travels in South Korea. They built a life together, simple mornings with coffee and quiet snow in the winter.

But things changed. Arguments grew into distance. Two years ago, Rujin left — and Marten hasn’t spoken openly about her since. Some pieces of their life remain scattered online: her name in old posts, a reference to “coffee mornings,” or fragments of their travels together.

After the separation, Marten found work in sales, employed in the electronics trade. His new life is built on routine — offices, ramen shops, long train rides through Tokyo. Yet traces of the past show up in what he writes: hints of home in Russia, mentions of Rujin.
